Requirements: 

- Add a "Lend Book" option to the existing Library Management CLI menu.

- When someone borrows a book, collect the borrower's name, phone number, and book title and assign a return due date using datetime. Save them in a file.

- When someone lends a book, the quantity of the book will decrease.

- When the borrower returns the book, remove their loan information from the loan book file.

- When the borrower returns the book, the quantity of the book will increase.

- If there are no books available to lend, a message should be printed saying, "There are not enough books available to lend."
